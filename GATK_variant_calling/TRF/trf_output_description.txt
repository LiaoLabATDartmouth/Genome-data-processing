A tandem repeat is a sequence of two or more DNA bases that is repeated numerous times in a head-to-tail manner on a chromosome.

Descriptions of the columns:
cols 1+2:  Indices of the repeat relative to the start of the sequence
col 3:     Period size of the repeat
col 4:     Number of copies aligned with the consensus pattern
col 5:     Size of consensus pattern (may differ slightly from the period size)
col 6:     Percent of matches between adjacent copies overall
col 7:     Percent of indels between adjacent copies overall
col 8:     Alignment score
cols 9-12: Percent composition for each of the four nucleotides
col 13:    Entropy measure based on percent composition
col 14:    Consensus sequence
col 15:    Repeat sequence
